# daybreakWidescreen
A Higurashi Daybreak Kai patcher/mod to get true widescreen, it supports various resolutions.

# How to use
First get the fixer [here](https://github.com/Olof-AV/DaybreakFix/releases/download/1.0/DaybreakFix_1_0.zip) <br/><br/>
The game .exe must be named DaybreakDX.exe not DaybreakDX-en.exe<br/><br/>
Extract the zip contents into the game's folder, then run the configResolution.exe found in the [releases](https://github.com/Vmarcelo49/daybreakWidescreen/releases) <br/><br/>
or just compile it by yourself.
